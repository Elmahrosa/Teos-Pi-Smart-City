## Full Version

We are thrilled to announce the launch of **TEOS&PI Smart City Elmahrosa** — Egypt's first fully Pi-powered civic smart city.

### What Makes It Special?

**100% Pi SDK Integration**  
Every component, from governance to treasury management, runs exclusively on the official Pi SDK. No external crypto, no bridges, no swaps — pure Pi economy.

**Accessible Participation**  
- **5 Pi petition fee** gets you civic registration
- **1,000 Pi per civic share** with unlimited acquisition
- Full voting rights and transparent treasury access

**Complete Civic Ecosystem**  
- Schools & universities
- Hospitals & healthcare
- Sports & recreation
- Banking & finance (Bank of Pi)
- Hotels & hospitality
- Shopping malls
- Public administration

### How It Works

1. **Petition System** — 5 Pi to register and participate in governance
2. **Civic Shares** — 1,000 Pi = 1 share (acquire more for greater voting power)
3. **Treasury Transparency** — Real-time dashboards showing all contributions and spending
4. **Community Governance** — Petition-first decision making with public auditing

### The Vision

Elmahrosa is the **prototype**. Once established in Egypt, this model will expand to other Egyptian cities and eventually create a **global network of Pi-powered smart cities**.
