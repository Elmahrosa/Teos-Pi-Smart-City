---

Dear Pioneer,

Today we're making history.

The **Egypt Digital Currency Regulation Petition** is now live inside the Teos & Pi Smart City app.

One button. One tap. One step closer to Egypt leading the Web3 revolution.

### Why This Petition Matters

For 6+ years, I've been building civic infrastructure on Pi Network. Schools, hospitals, finance, housing – all governed through transparent, Pi-only systems.

Now we're in final talks for **117 acres of prime downtown Alexandria land** to launch the world's first fully Pi-governed smart city.

Land value: **$2.2 billion USD**  
Missing piece: **Legal regulatory framework**

### Current Status

✅ **385 signatures** (77% to milestone)  
🎯 **500 = milestone** | **1,000+ = 5× win rate**  
⏰ **Goal: 1,000 this week**

### What We're Asking For

- Immediate drafting of digital assets & blockchain law
- Recognition of utility tokens and decentralized governance
- Protection for Egyptian pioneers and developers
- Clear licensing path for blockchain projects (including Pi smart cities)
