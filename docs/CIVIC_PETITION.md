## 📜 Alexandria Zone Civic Petition

We, the undersigned verified Pi Network Pioneers, hereby support the establishment of **Teos&Pi Smart City Elmahrosa** under the governance of **TEOS Egypt** and **Elmahrosa International**, founded by **Ayman Seif**.

### Our Commitment

By signing this petition with **5 Pi** and contributing a minimum stake of **1,000 Pi**, we affirm:

1. **Pi-Only Settlement**  
   All financial transactions within Teos&Pi Smart City are conducted exclusively in Pi. No external cryptocurrency swaps, bridges, or off-ramps are permitted.

2. **Alexandria Civic Zone Participation**  
   We support the acquisition and development of **110 acres (445,000 m²)** in Alexandria Downtown for the smart city project. Each **1,000 Pi contribution equals 1 civic share** (non-transferable outside Pi Network).

3. **Petition-First Governance**  
   We recognize that all major decisions require pioneer signatures and quorum approval through the petition system.

4. **Treasury Transparency**  
   We acknowledge that all contributions are logged in the public treasury ledger with hashed receipts in Pi memos, subject to auditor oversight.

5. **Dynamic Area Clause**  
   If the Alexandria 110-acre zone is sold, reassigned, or becomes unavailable, we agree that Teos&Pi Smart City may pivot to alternative locations:
   - Borg El Arab
   - New Alexandria
   - NAC (New Administrative Capital)
   
   Such pivots require a new petition with pioneer approval.

6. **Proprietary License Compliance**  
   We understand that the Teos&Pi Smart City repository and all intellectual property are proprietary to **TEOS Egypt** under a **Proprietary Civic License**:
   - No forks, redistribution, or derivative works
   - Badge-gated access for contributors
   - Governed by Egyptian law, jurisdiction in Alexandria

7. **Founder Authority**  
   We recognize **Ayman Seif** as the sole founder and owner of Teos&Pi Smart City Elmahrosa, operating under **Elmahrosa International (Est. 2007)**.
